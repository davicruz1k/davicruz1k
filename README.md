### Hi,ðŸ‘‹
# Who am i
I am Davi Cruz and I made games and love to create low level things, as built my own Operating System, but now I am making a new game engine, like bevy.
- I aleadry have built the math and physics things to the engine.
- I will compete with bevy, but in the sporting sense
- Bevy is the inspiration for the project
And yes I am 13 years old, and I'm from Brazil, PR.
# About my project of game engine
Him name is diot, the idea from the name come from idiot, but without the letter I, because in my mind "compete with bevy is a very idiot idea, they are 10 members building the bevy", and yes i will give my maximum to made that project the best who I made.
